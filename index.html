    <h2 id="AboutMe">About Me</h2>
    <p> I am currently a Team Leader however I qualified as a Primary School teacher back in 2016. I have always been interested in web development so decided to take the leap and enrol onto a 12-week Master Coding bootcamp at CodeNation.
    I am learning more and more each week and am excited to see where this journey takes me!</p>

  <p class="zengarden">I recreated the Zen Garden website by adding styling to the HTML. This was the first time I have ever done anything like this and I really enjoyed it!</p>
